# JSON-Parser
- The aim of this project is to parse a JSON file and display its content in a more appealing form in HTML page.
- The initial web page accepts an input JSON file name (stored in the same location as the HTML page) from the user.
- The JavaScript code then accepts this filename, checks if it has a .json extension and parses it. It further creates new HTML table elements and adds the appropriate content from the file in table headers and rows.
- The result is, a new window with HTML table having the JSON data.
- Technologies used:
  - Languages: JavaScript
  - Web technologies: HTML, CSS
